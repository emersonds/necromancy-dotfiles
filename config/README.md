## Config
The config files for each package used in the repo. After cloning the repo from GitHub, simply copy the files from the repo config folders to your local config folders. Some config folders may need to be created if they don't already exist.

To update the config for zsh, simply update `.zshrc` which is typically located in your home directory.

`sddm` is a little more tricky and may require root permissions to edit the folders located in `/usr/share/sddm`.

`swww` and `systemd` may also be tricky if you are unfamiliar with user-level services.
